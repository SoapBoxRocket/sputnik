* [ ] Publish Sputnik via Atom Package Manager

---

## Meetings

* Coffee 07:00
  - Sherri
  - Metroid @metroidcorgi

---

## Observations

* Should Sputnik have a toolbar to automatically add observations, action items, or anything else?

---

## Friction Points

* What's the difference between Action Items and Completed Actions?
  - I guess in general I need better section names

---

## Accomplishments

* Created sample file for Sputnik

---

## Wrap Up

The final section is a daily wrap up. It's a place to look back on the day and talk about it. I've got a fairly decent layout for the whold project, but still a number of questions I need to look at:
1. Should each program/project be it's own Atom project or all compbined into one big directory?
2. Should sections such as Action Items and Wrap Up be collected into a single file or just a script that puts them all together when needed?
3. Should I create a seperate file extension to make it easier to parse the files or keep them as a markdown extension?

At this point the biggest challenge will be to learn how to create this whole package for Atom.
